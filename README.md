# Women CAN Code Talks

A repo for organising talk proposals and discussing talks with speakers

## Talk Format

- Each event has 2-3 speaker slots available.  
- Each talk is allocated 20 minutes, however, this can be altered on a per-case basis.
- We also welcome shorter **lightning talks** for quick dives on node.js topics - 5-10 minutes max. Takes the pressure off
- Talks are recorded and posted onto the Women CAN Code [Twitch](https://www.twitch.com/womencancode) channel.  * Your permission is implied.


## Some loose talk guidelines
- we only host live talks with speakers in the house (no video link ups)
- We prefer hands on demos and live code-in-practice or a developer story to tell over org charts, process diagrams, product demos or corporate promo material.
- this is the London *Node.js* User group - we are a broad group of developers and touch many technlogies in our day to day lives - but try and keep the link to Node and JavaScript central to your talk

## First time speakers
- Our meetup is inclusive and friendly. If you need some speaking mentorship - we're here to help. Our organizers can provide a hand in multiple ways: Review your talk, provide tips & advice regarding public speaking, help with slides and general presentation.
**How?** Simply add a comment below your talk proposal (the github issue) that you're looking for some advice when you submit a talk.

## How
Its simple. [Open an issue](https://github.com/womencancode/event-speaker/issues/new) to submit a talk.  

Please structure the issue as following:

- Title: [Talk Title]
- Body: 
  - [Abstract of your talk]
  - [A bit about you, e.g. current job, twitter handle, etc.]
- I confirm my talk is 20 mins long in total.
- I confirm that I will abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://lnug.org/code-of-conduct.html)



If you are looking for feedback on your talk or have additional question, reply to your issue with  **extra comments** stating your questions but please keep them off the body of the original issue text itself

### Please conform to the issue structure so that we can use the api to automate some of the event admin.

## Confirmation
- Once your issue is assigned a milestone, it has been approved and confirmed.  
- Check the milestone date for confirmation of the event date.

## Code of conduct:
LNUG has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that speakers as well as attendees are expected to observe - please be sure to read it and comply with it in your participation with LNUG

## After the event
Please tweet a url to your slides and put the link in your proposal as a comment.

Thanks,
<3 WomenCANCode team
